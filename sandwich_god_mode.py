# interacting with the environment for quick models

# this model uses a method that is sometimes called 'god' mode
    # where the procedural production system knows and does everything
# for motor actions it uses 'delayed_actions'
    # this sets a seperate function to make a change in the environment
    # after a certain number of cycles
    # representing the delay for the action to be done
# for vision the productions are assumed to have perfect and instant access to the environment
    # this is done by treating the environement as both an environment and a memory

# this can be used to make quick models
# and can also be used as a first step in building a detailed cognitive model
